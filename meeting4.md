# Meeting4


We shall discuss and try out version/revision controls and git+github technologies. It will be *show and tell* type of event so please bring your laptop, install git and create account for github. If you want to play around. 

[It will be something like this](http://youtu.be/qT90jZP58jM) (You should replace the `code` with `text`, though they are not really different. Just characters.)
